# Popular Movies Project

## Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project 2 and 3, Popular Movies Stage 1 and 2

## Project Overview
### Stage 1
In Stage 1 I complete the **Popular Movies** app. This
app will connect to THE MOVIE DB and query the movies and
show posters in a grid based on user's list preference.
Clicking on a poster will transition to a detailed view
of the selected movie.
