# Popular Movies Project

## Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project 2 and 3, Popular Movies Stage 1 and 2

## Project Overview
### Stage 1
In Stage 1 I complete the **Popular Movies** app. This
app will connect to THE MOVIE DB and query the movies and
show posters in a grid based on user's list preference.
Clicking on a poster will transition to a detailed view
of the selected movie.

### Stage 2
In Stage 2 I will add more details to the Movie Detail View such as available trailers and reviews.

## Notes
### API Key
TMDB API Key should be stored in gradle.properties in the root directory. Within gradle.properties
you should define a properties in the following way:
TmdbApiKey = "your-api-key-goes-here"
